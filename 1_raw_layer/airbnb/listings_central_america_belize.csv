Both of us share a love of Latin American culture that has continued to solidify our friendship over the years. 
I frequently travel to both locations to know thoroughly the rentals and destinations!

My home base is in Tucson, Arizona, close to the Mexican border and a culture that is very close to my heart. My love of Latin culture and the Spanish language was inspired by my Mexican grandmother. I have traveled extensively in Mexico, Central America and South America.  I have been a hiking guide in the southwest (including the Grand Canyon) since 2000 and currently operate a guiding company in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico, home to the world renowned Tarahumaran.

From Reef to Ruins
I am enamored with Ambergris Caye and Cartagena and hope the enthusiasm is contagious!  
Most visitors are attracted to Belize for the water. The Caribbean offers innumerable opportunities for exploration. Belizean waters boast a myriad of amazing sea creatures, among them the incredible, huge and docile manatee. This beautiful giant is everywhere threatened, but Belize boasts the largest number of remaining manatees in the world. Explore the water from diving and snorkeling to simply hanging out on the beach! 
As amazing as the water is, what I find particularly appealing is the multi ethnicity of Ambergris Caye. One can stroll from one end of a street in San Pedro and hear not only English, the official language, but Spanish, Belizean creole and several dialects of Mayan. Want to pick up another language? Here’s your opportunity! People are open, friendly and kind.
Cartagena is a city like no other. Stroll aimlessly the streets of this World Heritage Site with a mind to simply ""take it all in"".  There is so much history in this city! From forts and beautiful colonial buildings, to great restaurants and museums, the Old Walled City has it all. And of course there is the wall itself and the sea!
As in Belize, the Colombians are unbelievably friendly and the Cartageneros particularly so. The Caribbean openness and ""laid back"" culture infuse everyone and everything. Shop for a few days in the local supermarket, and you'll be having little old ladies asking your advice on which cut of meat to buy!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

Both of us share a love of Latin American culture that has continued to solidify our friendship over the years. 
I frequently travel to both locations to know thoroughly the rentals and destinations!

My home base is in Tucson, Arizona, close to the Mexican border and a culture that is very close to my heart. My love of Latin culture and the Spanish language was inspired by my Mexican grandmother. I have traveled extensively in Mexico, Central America and South America.  I have been a hiking guide in the southwest (including the Grand Canyon) since 2000 and currently operate a guiding company in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico, home to the world renowned Tarahumaran.

From Reef to Ruins
I am enamored with Ambergris Caye and Cartagena and hope the enthusiasm is contagious!  
Most visitors are attracted to Belize for the water. The Caribbean offers innumerable opportunities for exploration. Belizean waters boast a myriad of amazing sea creatures, among them the incredible, huge and docile manatee. This beautiful giant is everywhere threatened, but Belize boasts the largest number of remaining manatees in the world. Explore the water from diving and snorkeling to simply hanging out on the beach! 
As amazing as the water is, what I find particularly appealing is the multi ethnicity of Ambergris Caye. One can stroll from one end of a street in San Pedro and hear not only English, the official language, but Spanish, Belizean creole and several dialects of Mayan. Want to pick up another language? Here’s your opportunity! People are open, friendly and kind.
Cartagena is a city like no other. Stroll aimlessly the streets of this World Heritage Site with a mind to simply ""take it all in"".  There is so much history in this city! From forts and beautiful colonial buildings, to great restaurants and museums, the Old Walled City has it all. And of course there is the wall itself and the sea!
As in Belize, the Colombians are unbelievably friendly and the Cartageneros particularly so. The Caribbean openness and ""laid back"" culture infuse everyone and everything. Shop for a few days in the local supermarket, and you'll be having little old ladies asking your advice on which cut of meat to buy!

Both of us share a love of Latin American culture that has continued to solidify our friendship over the years. 
I frequently travel to both locations to know thoroughly the rentals and destinations!

My home base is in Tucson, Arizona, close to the Mexican border and a culture that is very close to my heart. My love of Latin culture and the Spanish language was inspired by my Mexican grandmother. I have traveled extensively in Mexico, Central America and South America.  I have been a hiking guide in the southwest (including the Grand Canyon) since 2000 and currently operate a guiding company in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico, home to the world renowned Tarahumaran.

From Reef to Ruins
I am enamored with Ambergris Caye and Cartagena and hope the enthusiasm is contagious!  
Most visitors are attracted to Belize for the water. The Caribbean offers innumerable opportunities for exploration. Belizean waters boast a myriad of amazing sea creatures, among them the incredible, huge and docile manatee. This beautiful giant is everywhere threatened, but Belize boasts the largest number of remaining manatees in the world. Explore the water from diving and snorkeling to simply hanging out on the beach! 
As amazing as the water is, what I find particularly appealing is the multi ethnicity of Ambergris Caye. One can stroll from one end of a street in San Pedro and hear not only English, the official language, but Spanish, Belizean creole and several dialects of Mayan. Want to pick up another language? Here’s your opportunity! People are open, friendly and kind.
Cartagena is a city like no other. Stroll aimlessly the streets of this World Heritage Site with a mind to simply ""take it all in"".  There is so much history in this city! From forts and beautiful colonial buildings, to great restaurants and museums, the Old Walled City has it all. And of course there is the wall itself and the sea!
As in Belize, the Colombians are unbelievably friendly and the Cartageneros particularly so. The Caribbean openness and ""laid back"" culture infuse everyone and everything. Shop for a few days in the local supermarket, and you'll be having little old ladies asking your advice on which cut of meat to buy!

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon.

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

I'm Lisa, I first visited Belize in 2016 and fell in love with the feel of the country of Belize. Every region has it's own magic, but I found mine on Ambergris Caye in San Pedro. The people are the friendliest that you will find anywhere and will make you feel welcome! 

I am not just an Abnb host that has an extra bedroom or unit to rent out and want to make a few extra bucks.  Belize Tropical Dream Villas is a unique property with an invested and hospitality trained owner. This property and the guests that stay with me are the heart of my business!  

My life dreams and goals have included being near the ocean for years now and I have the heart for hospitality.  After getting dual degrees in Hospitality Management and Culinary Arts, I began looking for a place to make my dream a reality!  

Belize met my 5 criteria: 
1. Close to the ocean  
2. English speaking  
3. Easy currency conversion
4. Affordable and fairly quick for our guests to get to 
5. Affordable to purchase inside our means

When the opportunity was presented to be able to purchase an apartment building in my favorite city - I decided to make a leap of faith and catch my dream! 

I am excited to share the island with you, help you feel comfortable and at home here, and most important - ensure that you have a most memorable vacation filled with experiences unique to the beautiful country of Belize!

Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.  Living on the beach for almost 20 years just 60' from that beautiful teal water was magical.  As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

Belize met my 5 criteria: 
1. Close to the ocean  
2. English speaking  
3. Easy currency conversion
4. Affordable and fairly quick for our guests to get to 
5. Affordable to purchase inside our means

When the opportunity was presented to be able to purchase an apartment building in my favorite city - I decided to make a leap of faith and catch my dream!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.73812,-88.02829,Entire home,Entire home/apt,8,,2 baths,,4,[],$232.00,1,1125,1,4,2,1125,1.8,260.3,,t,28,58,88,348,2023-12-27,68,4,0,2016-09-11,2023-09-10,4.44,4.4,4.66,4.65,4.64,4.33,4.6,,t,232,217,15,0,0.77

Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.  Living on the beach for almost 20 years just 60' from that beautiful teal water was magical.  As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

 

One of the best things I like about Belize is that I can afford to have someone help run our business,  have a housekeeper and a gardener which allows me the time to do the creative things I want to do while providing jobs for talented Belizeans.

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Because I work full time I am honest about the time when I can be available on any given day.

When I myself travel, I love to do so by road whenever possible and by staying at more basic accommodations, because I think that's when you best get to KNOW the people and place you visit.  I also like to have a fixed base and make day trips...something that is quite possible living in Belmopan, as it is in the center of the small but beautiful country of Belize.

I came to Belize from Boston to start a new life by developing land. It took five years before the first house was delivered.  Over that time,  I picked up knowledge, and experience of this beautifully wild, natural country.

 Mary is a village girl and we started a family in 2012. She can make baskets and cook on a fire hearth. She also likes to do nails, dress up, yet has a wealth of information from living off the land.

Faith, our daughter was born premature, but she survived (a miracle) and thrives.  

We work,  but enjoy our downtime with music, creative activities, or relaxing with a nice drink. Mary likes to play cards and socialize. Faith loves the outdoors, playing, climbing trees, and riding her bike.

We also enjoy having guests for conversation and hospitality. We have done birthday parties, cookouts, and holiday spreads with our guests.

Belize met my 5 criteria: 
1. Close to the ocean  
2. English speaking  
3. Easy currency conversion
4. Affordable and fairly quick for our guests to get to 
5. Affordable to purchase inside our means

When the opportunity was presented to be able to purchase an apartment building in my favorite city - I decided to make a leap of faith and catch my dream!

The story of our Villa has been a long time in the making. In fact, it goes all the way back to 2003, when Brian received a life-changing diagnosis. 
 
When you learn you have Stage 4 cancer and are given just six months to live, you begin to reflect on the things that are important to you.

For us it was family and loved ones first and foremost – and the wonderful experiences we could share together.

It was during that trying time when the idea of a beachside retreat came to us. But our dream seemed just that – a dream.

Brian was undergoing treatment, and we were fighting with all that we had to hold on to him.

One evening, with the lyrics of the Beach Boys’ Kokomo washing over us, we made a bold decision. We’d fight through this, and when Brian was well enough, we’d begin exploring the beauty of the Caribbean.

That day finally came, and we were off to Jamaica and then Aruba shortly thereafter.

Years passed, and life intervened, but that dream was always in front of us.

Then one year our travels took us to the stunning beaches of Placencia, Belize.

With its perfect weather, gorgeous setting and wonderful people, Placencia captured our hearts like nowhere else. We knew we’d found the setting for our Villa.

Every piece of Manatee Villa has been crafted for spending time with loved ones – for relaxing, connecting and making memories together.

It’s luxurious, private and a true home away from home in one of the most relaxing settings in the world.

And we’re delighted to have you join our family and become a part of our story.

Because our Villa is your villa. And we can’t wait for you to arrive!

- Brian and Brenda

P.s. If you’d like to learn more about Brian’s inspiring story, you can pick up a copy of his new book ""The Nice Entrepreneur"" on Amazon.

After years of research and reconnaissance, working multiple jobs and saving as much as possible, we finally dropped our old life, quit those jobs, and moved to Belize.  We chose Placencia as our paradise, and bought this guesthouse within weeks of arriving.  Since then we have enjoyed adapting to the “Barefoot Perfect” lifestyle of the village. We love living in this warm community full of friendly faces and being within walking distance of everywhere we need to go.

Phil’s passion is health and fitness and appreciates being active outdoors year-round. While enjoying all the perks that Belize offers, he has not totally abandoned his prior career path and still works remotely as a physical therapist. 

Megan dabbles in real estate, indulges her creative side by writing a blog (Real Life Recess) and crafting, and is also a superb source of information on expat life, village happenings,  and unique experiences.

Both of us share a love of Latin American culture that has continued to solidify our friendship over the years. 
I frequently travel to both locations to know thoroughly the rentals and destinations!

My home base is in Tucson, Arizona, close to the Mexican border and a culture that is very close to my heart. My love of Latin culture and the Spanish language was inspired by my Mexican grandmother. I have traveled extensively in Mexico, Central America and South America.  I have been a hiking guide in the southwest (including the Grand Canyon) since 2000 and currently operate a guiding company in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico, home to the world renowned Tarahumaran.

From Reef to Ruins
I am enamored with Ambergris Caye and Cartagena and hope the enthusiasm is contagious!  
Most visitors are attracted to Belize for the water. The Caribbean offers innumerable opportunities for exploration. Belizean waters boast a myriad of amazing sea creatures, among them the incredible, huge and docile manatee. This beautiful giant is everywhere threatened, but Belize boasts the largest number of remaining manatees in the world. Explore the water from diving and snorkeling to simply hanging out on the beach! 
As amazing as the water is, what I find particularly appealing is the multi ethnicity of Ambergris Caye. One can stroll from one end of a street in San Pedro and hear not only English, the official language, but Spanish, Belizean creole and several dialects of Mayan. Want to pick up another language? Here’s your opportunity! People are open, friendly and kind.
Cartagena is a city like no other. Stroll aimlessly the streets of this World Heritage Site with a mind to simply ""take it all in"".  There is so much history in this city! From forts and beautiful colonial buildings, to great restaurants and museums, the Old Walled City has it all. And of course there is the wall itself and the sea!
As in Belize, the Colombians are unbelievably friendly and the Cartageneros particularly so. The Caribbean openness and ""laid back"" culture infuse everyone and everything. Shop for a few days in the local supermarket, and you'll be having little old ladies asking your advice on which cut of meat to buy!

3. Easy currency conversion
4. Affordable and fairly quick for our guests to get to 
5. Affordable to purchase inside our means

I began my travels to Belize in early 2004.  Immediately falling in love with the country I continued visiting, making at least four trips a year.  Ultimately, the frequent visits led me to moving and living full time in Belize twice - once owning and operating a business catering to both locals and tourists, and the second time my husband and I just needed to get back and enjoy the so many things we were missing about the country.  I currently split my time between N. Carolina, Louisiana, and Belize.  I continue to explore all options for your adventure, and trust me; the adventure never stops in Belize. 

I have had the opportunity to travel extensively throughout the entire country of Belize, and I can tell you that Sunset Beach is one of my favorite properties in San Pedro.  The owners do a great job of keeping up the property and paying a lot of attention to detail.  Sunset Beach is the perfect location being 2.5 miles south of San Pedro Town.  The south end of Ambergris Caye is so peaceful, and Sunset Beach is just minutes away from town while traveling down a mostly paved road.  About 1/4 mile before you reach Sunset Beach the road becomes nice and sandy that is well maintained.

This unique property sits on 200 feet of beachfront for only 13 units, which never gives you the feeling of being over crowded.  

I can also assist you with all your needs while in Belize (booking your local flights, a golf cart rental, or any excursions you may be interested in).  I will pass on my many suggestions and tips for the area.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Stann Creek Mainland,Stann Creek,16.51618,-88.36854,Entire cabin,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],$109.00,1,1125,1,3,2,1125,1.4,689.4,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,5,1,0,2018-03-22,2023-02-10,3.6,3.6,4.6,4.0,4.2,4.2,3.2,,t,232,217,15,0,0.07

Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.

As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

Belize met my 5 criteria: 
1. Close to the ocean  
2. English speaking  
3. Easy currency conversion
4. Affordable and fairly quick for our guests to get to 
5. Affordable to purchase inside our means

When the opportunity was presented to be able to purchase an apartment building in my favorite city - I decided to make a leap of faith and catch my dream!

Stephen was also the navigator of “Ten Romeo” a single engine Beach Bonanza from Albany, New York to the North Pole.

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to).

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

Take pleasure in visiting Iguana Reef to experience the breathtaking sunset view while catching sight of the seahorses and stingrays.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-24571109/original/3687a194-5811-4ad4-a77f-7cd5e3538999.jpeg,144478335,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/144478335,Brandon,2017-08-05,"New Orleans, LA","Hi , my name is Brandon and my Husband is Adam and we hope to be your host on the magical island of Caye Caulker .

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Stann Creek Mainland,Stann Creek,16.51801,-88.36928,Entire villa,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],$168.00,1,1125,1,4,169,1125,1.5,679.5,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,17,3,0,2019-04-07,2023-04-05,4.41,4.47,4.88,4.71,4.24,4.82,4.59,,t,232,217,15,0,0.30

The resort is on an island off the coast of Belize, just over a mile south of San Pedro Town, which is far enough from the hustle and bustle to provide a truly tranquil setting and its own private beach access (the cove shaped beach is over 300ft long!).

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

I am also a real estate broker and the owner of Belize Live-Retire-Invest  which is myself and a group of expats dedicated to helping other people relocate to Belize. 


Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.  Living on the beach for almost 20 years just 60' from that beautiful teal water was magical.  As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

 

One of the best things I like about Belize is that I can afford to have someone help run our business,  have a housekeeper and a gardener which allows me the time to do the creative things I want to do while providing jobs for talented Belizeans.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.93518,-87.95466,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,,2,[],$208.00,3,1125,3,4,3,1125,3.0,359.8,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,12,0,0,2018-12-12,2020-01-31,4.67,4.83,4.75,5.0,4.83,4.92,4.92,,t,232,217,15,0,0.20

After  accomplishing my college degree in 2008 I fell in love with the island and eventually moved to reside in Caye Caulker. 
Ever since my stay, I have been working at various businesses within the island gaining invaluable experiences, meeting many faces and knowing the areas within my community. I then worked for Caye Caulker Rentals, now known as Caye Caulker Vacation Homes as a receptionist, then promoted to manager and eventually became the new owner of the business.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.74189,-88.02577,Entire home,Entire home/apt,6,,2 baths,,4,[],$426.00,1,1125,1,4,2,1125,2.0,239.1,,t,17,43,73,348,2023-12-27,13,6,0,2019-07-09,2023-04-07,4.77,4.77,5.0,4.85,4.92,4.69,4.69,,t,232,217,15,0,0.24

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to).

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.8906,-87.97948,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],$141.00,1,1125,1,4,1,1125,1.9,230.7,,t,16,41,67,342,2023-12-27,30,7,3,2020-02-12,2023-12-22,4.5,4.5,4.63,4.63,4.5,4.63,4.5,,t,232,217,15,0,0.64

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to).

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Cayo,Cayo,17.1459,-89.07649,Entire home,Entire home/apt,6,,2 baths,,3,[],$254.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.0,253.1,,t,27,51,81,356,2023-12-27,48,14,0,2020-02-09,2023-11-11,4.73,4.85,4.83,4.81,4.69,4.79,4.69,,t,232,217,15,0,1.02

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Stann Creek Mainland,Stann Creek,16.86074,-88.28497,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,1,[],$210.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.0,331.8,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,22,2,1,2020-02-25,2023-12-22,4.73,4.82,4.91,4.64,4.73,4.82,4.5,,t,232,217,15,0,0.47

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Not only will you be able to enjoy a restful day on a quiet beach, you will have a quiet night as well – no bar or restaurant noise, just swaying coconut fronds and the occasional fish jumping in the water!<br /><br />Town is not far away when you want to go in for some live music, shopping, restaurants, etc. But there are things relatively close by too, such as:<br />-Playa de Sala rooftop bar & restaurant: < 1 mile<br />-Stax Container Bar: 1 mile<br />-Pelican Reef Grill, Happy's Tequileria & Black Orchid Restaurants: 2 miles<b",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/600bd42b-3833-4b06-b6bc-774260faaca3.jpg,1120393,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1120393,"Barbara, Belize & Colombia",2011-09-06,United States,"I've lived most of my life in the U.S. (where I am from) but have also lived for a couple of months to up to two years in different countries: Germany, Spain, Australia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, & Belize. Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

After years of research and reconnaissance, working multiple jobs and saving as much as possible, we finally dropped our old life, quit those jobs, and moved to Belize.  We chose Placencia as our paradise, and bought this guesthouse within weeks of arriving.  Since then we have enjoyed adapting to the “Barefoot Perfect” lifestyle of the village. We love living in this warm community full of friendly faces and being within walking distance of everywhere we need to go.

Phil’s passion is health and fitness and appreciates being active outdoors year-round. While enjoying all the perks that Belize offers, he has not totally abandoned his prior career path and still works remotely as a physical therapist. 

Megan dabbles in real estate, indulges her creative side by writing a blog (Real Life Recess) and crafting, and is also a superb source of information on expat life, village happenings,  and unique experiences.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to).

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Stann Creek Mainland,Stann Creek,16.55817,-88.36373,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,2,[],$192.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.0,257.9,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,21,5,0,2021-02-14,2023-04-06,4.24,4.43,4.57,4.95,4.62,4.86,4.57,,t,232,217,15,0,0.60

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.93405,-87.95673,Entire villa,Entire home/apt,4,,1.5 baths,,3,[],$285.00,3,1125,3,4,7,1125,3.0,727.0,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,5,3,0,2022-04-02,2023-06-29,5.0,5.0,4.6,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,t,232,217,15,0,0.24

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team.

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

I am also a real estate broker and the owner of Belize Live-Retire-Invest  which is myself and a group of expats dedicated to helping other people relocate to Belize. 


Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.  Living on the beach for almost 20 years just 60' from that beautiful teal water was magical.  As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

 

One of the best things I like about Belize is that I can afford to have someone help run our business,  have a housekeeper and a gardener which allows me the time to do the creative things I want to do while providing jobs for talented Belizeans.  Belize is not for everyone and it is only what you make of it.

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.73654,-88.02881,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,2,,1 bath,,2,[],$95.00,2,1125,2,3,2,1125,2.0,696.3,,t,30,60,90,365,2023-12-27,13,13,0,2023-01-05,2023-11-20,4.38,4.38,4.38,4.54,4.69,3.85,4.31,,t,232,217,15,0,1.09

Originally from Texas I am a sculptor, painter and a custom home builder who knows how to pay attention to detail.   After visiting Belize in the '80s my husband and I returned to the states, sold our home and business and relocated to Belize in 1991.  Living on the beach for almost 20 years just 60' from that beautiful teal water was magical.  As the island changed the magic did disappear and the new dream became building a luxury Eco-resort in the jungle.

 

One of the best things I like about Belize is that I can afford to have someone help run our business,  have a housekeeper and a gardener which allows me the time to do the creative things I want to do while providing jobs for talented Belizeans.

I grew up outside of Toronto, Ontario but spent most of my adult life in British Columbia, Canada experiencing the fulfilling coastal and mountain culture.

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

We can’t wait to meet you and welcome you to beautiful Belize!
See you soon. 

Smiles!

In 2013, I took my first trip to Belize and now spend 6 months of the year on Ambergris Caye where I host a plethora of architecturally stunning oceanfront holiday homes to wonderful guests like you. These homes are ideal and can accommodate anywhere from 8 - 98 guests which are perfect for large groups, weddings, birthdays and other events.  

After a few years, and many guests requesting similar homes and services in the lush mountains of Belize,  I decided to expand our rental inventory and offer our guests a luxurious ""Surf n"" Turf"" package that includes 3-4 nights in one of our island homes and 3-4 nights in one of our lush mountain villas in San Ignacio, Cayo. 
If you desire to experience Belize in a most epic way then we have something for every guest in modern, stylish, safe, comfortable and clean environments within the most desirable communities. 

If I am unable to be on location when guests arrive than one of my representatives will meet/greet you upon arrival, transfer you to our properties, and assist you with anything you may need. Our concierge is the finest!

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.74067,-88.02556,Entire home,Entire home/apt,4,,2 baths,,2,[],$311.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.0,338.4,,t,26,56,86,361,2023-12-27,6,6,0,2023-05-01,2023-09-03,4.83,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,4.83,,t,232,217,15,0,0.75

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to).

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.8826,-88.00205,Entire home,Entire home/apt,6,,3 baths,,3,[],$735.00,3,1125,3,6,3,1125,3.1,285.2,,t,22,41,64,339,2023-12-27,3,3,1,2023-07-03,2023-12-10,5.0,5.0,4.67,4.33,5.0,4.67,5.0,,t,232,217,15,0,0.51

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.928627654234894,-87.95774655987746,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,3,,1 bath,,2,[],$222.00,1,1125,1,4,1,1125,1.8,317.4,,t,29,59,89,364,2023-12-27,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,t,232,217,15,0,

Since 2011 I've been living a somewhat nomadic lifestyle while exploring, working & volunteering in new & old places in the Americas and Europe. It's a great way to keep learning!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

In my travels I stumbled upon the opportunity to do something that I love -- helping vacation rental owners help people like you with their dream vacations on Ambergris Caye, Belize!

I also have a condo in Cartagena, Colombia; if you're looking for a 30+ night stay (to volunteer; learn Spanish, salsa dancing, or scuba diving; work remotely with a Caribbean view; escape the winter...) let me know!

'Pack for a Purpose' is an organization that links travelers who'd like to help fulfill wish lists of non-profits in developing countries. I partner with them with schools, community organizations & animal rescue groups in both Colombia & Belize. These groups would love to have your help!

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.",within an hour,100%,99%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/57602506-d9d7-44e3-b321-2c9221e2e33f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Belama Phase 3,245,559,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Belize Islands,Belize,17.989245725026453,-87.91967150562154,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,4,,2 baths,,2,[],$440.00,2,1125,2,4,2,1125,2.0,245.7,,t,19,48,78,353,2023-12-27,2,2,2,2023-12-04,2023-12-22,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,t,232,217,15,0,2
