## 1. Abstract

This Case was proposed by [LeadSimple](https://leadsimple.com/) in its selection process for the vacancy of Product Data Analyst. Its main objective is to verify the candidate's proficiency in tools such as: Python, SQL, Data Visualization, and Cloud Computing.

For this, an end-to-end data project was developed based on the last year information available on the [DigitalOcean.ie](https://www.digitalocean.ie/Home/About) portal, which gathers data from various sources on Irelandâ€™s maritime zone.

The aims of the project were divided in two parts:

 * **Part 1:** Answer the following questions about the Irish sea. Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/irish-sea#45-exploratory-data-analysis) to go to Part 1.
     - Q1: What is the lowest temperature of each one of the Bouys? Which usually month it occurs?
     - Q2: Where (lat/long) do we have the biggest water level? Which usually month it occurs?
     - Q3: How the Wave Lenghts correlates with Sea Temperature? It is possible to predict with accuracy the Wave Lenght, based on the Sea Temperature and the Bouy location?
     
 * **Part 2:** Development of a Regression Model applied to time series to predict the sea temperature throughout the year. Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/irish-sea#6-machine-learning-modeling) to go to Part 2.

## 2. Methodology

The CRISP-DM framework was the guide for this data project development. 

CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts and it includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, the tasks involved with each phase, and an explanation of the relationships between these tasks.
