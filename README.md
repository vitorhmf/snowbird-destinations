## 1. Abstract

This Data Science Case was proposed by [Dadosfera](https://dadosfera.ai/) in its selection process for the vacancy of Data Scientist. Its main objective is to verify the candidate's proficiency in tools such as: SQL, Python and Cloud Computing.

For this, a data project was developed based on the last year information available on the [DigitalOcean.ie](https://www.digitalocean.ie/Home/About) portal, which gathers data from various sources on Irelandâ€™s maritime zone.

The aims of the project were divided in two parts:

 * **Part 1:** Answer the following questions about the Irish sea. Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/irish-sea#45-exploratory-data-analysis) to go to Part 1.
     - Q1: What is the lowest temperature of each one of the Bouys? Which usually month it occurs?
     - Q2: Where (lat/long) do we have the biggest water level? Which usually month it occurs?
     - Q3: How the Wave Lenghts correlates with Sea Temperature? It is possible to predict with accuracy the Wave Lenght, based on the Sea Temperature and the Bouy location?
     
 * **Part 2:** Development of a Regression Model applied to time series to predict the sea temperature throughout the year. Click [here](https://github.com/vitorhmf/irish-sea#6-machine-learning-modeling) to go to Part 2.
